    "> The Hertzsprung-Russell Diagram (HR Diagram) is a tool that astronomers use to show the classification of stars, while also showing the life and evolution of said stars. This diagram plots the luminosity as a function of the temperature of the star. Other HR diagrams can show the absolute magnitude as a function of the spectral type of the star. \n",

    "#### Main Sequence Stars\n",
    "> This is the main strip of stars that starts from the upper left of the graph and goes to the lower right. The stars in the upper left represent very hot, luminous stars, where the stars in the bottom right represent cooler, dimmer stars. The main sequence is where stars spend most of their lives.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Giant and Supergiant Stars\n",
    "> Stars become giants or supergiants towards the end of their lives. The surface temperature of the star starts to cool, and they start to grow in size making them more luminous. Stars enter this phase when they run out of hydrogen to fuse, so they start to fuse helium or heavier elements depending on the mass of the star.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### White Dwarf Stars\n",
    "> Stars in this region show the final evolutionary stage of low to intermediate mass stars; a high-mass star will not become a white dwarf star, they tend to end their lives as supernovas, or as a black hole. White dwarf stars are very hot, but they aren't very bright due to their small size.\n",

A good way to clean up the data is to find where the parallax angles are the most similar. The parallax effect is the apparant difference in position of an object depending on where you view the object. This effect is illustrated in the graphic below. Similar parallax angles mean that the stars are relatively close together. Finding where angles are most similar in the data, helps reduce the chance of plotting stars that are not in the cluster.\n",

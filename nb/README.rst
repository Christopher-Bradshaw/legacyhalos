Guide to Jupyter Notebooks
==========================

This README briefly describes the purpose of each notebook, and the logical
order in which they should be reviewed.

Preparatory Work
----------------

* (redMaPPer
  CasJobs)[https://github.com/moustakas/legacyhalos/blob/master/nb/redmapper-casjobs.ipynb]
  -- Gather SDSS/DR14 *ugriz* and unWISE *W1-W4* (forced) photometry for the
  parent sample of redMaPPer central galaxies.

* (Match
  LegacySurvey-redMapper)[https://github.com/moustakas/legacyhalos/blob/master/nb/match-legacysurvey-redmapper.ipynb]
  -- Documentation describing how the updated redMaPPer catalog is matched to
  the Legacy Survey DR3 catalogs. 

Analysis
--------
* (Building a Parent
  Sample)[https://github.com/moustakas/legacyhalos/blob/master/nb/legacysurvey-redmapper-parent.ipynb]
  -- Build a parent sample of galaxies satisfying the following criteria: (1) in
  the redMaPPer cluster catalog; (2) has full-depth Legacy Survey grzW1W2
  imaging as part of the third data release (DR3); and (3) has UPenn-PhotDec
  photometry.

Stellar Mass Content of Dark Matter Halos in Legacy Survey Imaging
==================================================================

The `Legacy Survey`_ is delivering deep *grz* optical imaging and unWISE *W1* and *W2*
mid-infrared imaging of over 14,000 sq. deg of the extragalactic sky.

This repository contains code and papers for a multi-pronged analysis of the
group- and cluster-scale dark matter halos identified in Legacy Survey imaging,
particularly the stellar mass content of the central galaxies.  

The key science goals are to:

1. Obtain an accurate census of the integrated stellar masses of massive central
   galaxies---which dominate the massive end of the galaxy stellar mass
   function---as a function of halo mass and redshift.

2. Measure the stellar mass density profiles and structural properties (e.g.,
   half-mass radius, concentration), and their correlation with dark matter halo
   assembly histories.  

3. Measure the stellar mass-halo mass relation and the scatter in the stellar
   masses of central galaxies, as a probe of star formation efficiency and
   feedback in massive systems.

4. Measure the fraction of stars formed *in situ* versus *ex situ* in massive
   spheroidal galaxies.

5. And lots more!

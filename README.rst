Stellar Mass Content of Dark Matter Halos in Legacy Survey Imaging
==================================================================

The `Legacy Survey`_ is delivering deep *grz* optical imaging and unWISE *W1* and *W2*
mid-infrared imaging of over 14,000 sq. deg of the extragalactic sky.

This repository contains code and papers for a multi-pronged analysis of the
group- and cluster-scale dark matter halos identified in Legacy Survey imaging,
particularly the stellar mass content of the central galaxies.  

We gratefully acknowledge partial funding support for this work from the National
Science Foundation (NSF) grant AST-1616414.
